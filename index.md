Hi! I'm Robin Salen, currently working as cryptographer at [Toposware](https://toposware.com/),
where I am playing around various cryptographic primitives and proving systems. I am trying to 
use both my mathematician and developer skills to make the digital world a better place, either
through my job or side projects and collaborations! And when I'm not working, I may either be doing
some photography, practicing piano, or just sleeping until the sun rises again ðŸ˜ƒ

My interests in crypto(graphy) are wide and include, but are not limited to, elliptic curves and pairings,
zero-knowledge proofs, symmetric primitives and fully homomorphic encryption. Below are a few projects I
have worked on with peers, if you think we could be a good fit together, I am always up for fun collaborations
so shoot me an email! ðŸ˜‰
