Hi! I'm Robin Salen, currently working as cryptographer at [Toposware](https://toposware.com/),
where I am playing around various cryptographic primitives and proving systems. I am trying to 
use both my mathematician and developer skills to make the digital world a better place, either
through my job or side projects and collaborations.

My interests in crypto(graphy) are wide and include, but are not limited to, elliptic curves and pairings,
zero-knowledge proofs, symmetric primitives and fully homomorphic encryption.
